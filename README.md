# My Discord Bots

SmileyBot has since been split up into multiple different bots. These bots have hundreds of different features, spanning over 80 thousand lines of code.

This is now a past project which will not be updated further with new features, but I will fix critical bugs to keep the bots working.

To find out more about or use this project, see the website: https://joshhumphriss.com/bots

The code for this project is not publicly available.
